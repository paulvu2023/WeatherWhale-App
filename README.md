## Features

With WeatherWhale, you can:

- **Check Current Weather**: Get real-time updates on the current weather conditions for any location worldwide.

- **2-Day Forecast**: Plan ahead with a 2-day weather forecast to ensure you're prepared for changes in weather.

- **Hourly Forecast**: Dive into the details with an hourly forecast for the next 24 hours, so you can make informed decisions about your day.

- **Time and Date**: Easily check the current time and date within the app, so you're always in sync with your schedule.

- **Location-Based Weather**: Enter any location to get instant weather information for that area, whether you're at home or traveling.

- **Unit Conversion**: Customize your experience by switching between Fahrenheit and Celsius for temperature, and between kilometers and miles for distance.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WeatherAPI

This web application works by allowing the user to enter a location, and fetching information from the WeatherAPI based on the location. It repackages and beautifies the information with HTML and CSS. JavaScript is used for everything behind the scenes.

# Improvements:

WeatherWhale could be improved by implementing a 14 day forecast. This would require a 35 dollar per month subscription to WeatherAPI, that's why I decided to stick with the free 3 day forecast.
